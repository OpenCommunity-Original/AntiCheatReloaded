=============
AntiCheatReloaded is currently **unmaintained.** There will be **no further updates** to the current codebase and **no support** will be provided. The last released version (1.10.3) supports 1.12.2 - 1.18.1. You can use this version of the plugin **at your own risk**. Some development may occur on a completely rewritten version of the plugin. No support or definitive release date is provided for this version. You can follow its progress [here](https://github.com/Rammelkast/AntiCheatReloaded/tree/version-2). 

Installation
------------
AntiCheatReloaded **requires** you to have ProtocolLib. You can download it [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).
Simply drag and drop the AntiCheatReloaded and ProtocolLib jars in your plugin folder. You can now use AntiCheatReloaded, but be sure to have a look at the configuration files, which allow you to change every aspect of the plugin.
